Hello, @Model.CoachName

It is coaches like yourself that are enhancing, improving and developing this great game of hockey!!!  Thank you for putting in the time and effort to create an incredible experience for the players.
                                                   
Hockey is evolving and changing each and every year. We believe with new ideas, approaches and innovations we can continue to enhance and grow the game of hockey for all to enjoy.
                                                   
Use the following code to allow coaches within your organization to register and use the system.
                                                   
Code: @Model.AssociationCode
                                                   
**Note: The coach you created during the signup process does not count towards your use of licenses, it was used simply to verify details for payment and will not be activated.
                                                   
Best of luck,
