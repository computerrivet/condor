# Condor
The fast and easy email templating system for ASP.NET

*What is it?* 

Condor makes it very easy to send email from a .NET application. The biggest feature is that it allows you to write Razor templates that can be merged with a model class you define and populate at runtime. 

Condor stated life as a utility component in the thedrillbook.com codebase. Because of a code rewrite, this code was 
released (thanks Mark!) so others like yourself can use and contribute to the project. 

This project intends to make sending email as effortless as the Condor can soar. :)

The current codebase is not ready to be used (yet). While the project will compile, it still needs some cleanup. The next stop for the project is the 0.1 Milestone that will make it usable from any .NET project. 

The RoadMap
===========
0.1 - Remove all company specific cruft, externalize template loading, provide support for other email services (Mandrill).
