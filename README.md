# Condor
The fast and easy email templating system for ASP.NET

*What is it?* 

Condor makes it very easy to send email from .NET application. It biggest feature it supports is it allows you to write Razor templates 
that will be merged with a model class you define. 

Condor stated life as a utility component in the thedrillbook.com codebase. Because of a code rewrite, this code was generously 
released (thanks Mark!) so others like yourself can use and contribute to the project. 

This project intends to make sending email as effortless as the Condor can soar. :)

The current codebase is not ready to be used (yet). While the project will compile, it still contains references that need to be removed. 
Of course, nothing important like usernames/passwords. 


The RoadMap
===========
0.1 - Remove all company specific cruft, externalize template loading, provide support for other email services (Mandrill).
